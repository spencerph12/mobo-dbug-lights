			The obvious start with this would be to reseat the ram, and make sure they are in the correct slots that correspond to what mode you are running. <b> <I> ALL </I> </b> motherboard manufactures state in the manual where to place the ram. 
		</li>
		<li> 
			Make sure your ram is compatible with your motherboard and cpu. 
		</li>
		<li> 
			Test the sticks in another system, if they fail in the other system, then it's time to RMA the ram. 
		</li>
		<li> 
			The next step is to test the slots on the motherboard, if you have known working ram use that to test the slots if not use what you have, to test the slots use one stick at a time and test it in each of the slots, if you use more than one stick retest the slots with each individual stick, if you can confirm the problem to be the motherboard then RMA
