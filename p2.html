	<ol class="simple">
		<li> 
			If you have a motherboard system speaker, listen to the beep codes created during a failed post. Compare them to a beep code sheet to diagnose the problem, if one is supplied by the motherboard manufacturer check there if not here is a generalized list of there meanings, <a href="https://www.computerhope.com/beep.htm" target="_blank"> Computer POST and beep codes. </a> 
		</li>
		<li> 
			Make sure the Cpu power cable are seated in correctly, this is a common mistake and very easily fixable, also check if <b> <i> ALL </i> </b> of the pins are in the connector and you do not have one hanging out of the connector causing some of the power to be lost. 
		</li>
		<li>
			Reseating the Cpu not only can fix this it can fix a multitude of other problems. When doing this step check for bent pins. 
		</li>
		<li> 
			Make sure your ram is installed into the correct slots and that the ram is seated correctly. Check for a system post when other ram is installed. 
		</li>
		<li> 
			It is possible for your motherboard to be defective, if possible text the cpu in another system. If the other system works then the fault is in the motherboard, if the other system does not work with the cpu in it then the fault lies in the cpu. If you are capable of testing these and you get one of those outcomes RMA the motherboard/cpu.
