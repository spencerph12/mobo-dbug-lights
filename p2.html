		If your motherboards debug lights are stuck at cpu and won't pass a post, these are some troubleshooting tips to fix the problem.
		below will list some of the simplest fixes and some of the most known to work, it is not recommended to do these out of order.
	</p>

	<ol class="simple">
		<li> 
			If you have a motherboard system speaker, listen to the beep codes created during a failed post. Compare them to a beep code sheet to diagnose the problem, if one is supplied by the motherboard manufacturer check there if not here is a generalized list of there meanings, <a href="https://www.computerhope.com/beep.htm" target="_blank"> Computer POST and beep codes. </a> 
		</li>
		<li> 
			Make sure the Cpu power cable are seated in correctly, this is a common mistake and very easily fixable, also check if <b> <i> ALL </i> </b> of the pins are in the connector and you do not have one hanging out of the connector causing some of the power to be lost. 
		</li>
		<li>
			Reseating the Cpu not only can fix this, it can fix a multitude of other problems. While doing this step check for bent pins. 
		</li>
		<li> 
			Make sure your ram is installed into the correct slots and that the ram is seated correctly. If possible, check for a system post with other ram installed. 
		</li>
		<li> 
			It is possible for your motherboard to be defective, if possible test the cpu in another system. If the other system works then the fault is in the motherboard, if the other system does not work then the fault lies in the cpu. Which ever part was causing the issue RMA the said part. If the issue persists after the RMA then the problem lies somewhere else.
